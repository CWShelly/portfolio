In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. We have a saboteur aboard. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. They were just sucked into space. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Your shields were failing, sir.",

"blog":" Knowing those three things, the way forward became clear to me. I first seriously grappled with the concept reparations in my early 20s, in the form Randall Robinson's moving argument in The Debt. A taut and beautifully rendered book, The Debt mostly focuses on enslavement. But I remember sitting with Robinson some years ago—he was the subject of my first big profile for a national magazine—and hearing him almost off-handedly note that housing discrimination alone is estimated to have cost black people billions. And I recall dimly thinking, 'Some of those people are alive.' One critique made by those who oppose reparations holds that the claim is null because it was made so long after the actual injury, when all members of the injured class were dead. But this is not true of a claim rooted in housing discrimination. Maps show who lived where. Records of the policies are clear. Histories have been written outlining the execution of these policies and their effects. Indeed, a paper trail probably exists for those who'd been directly refused loans. I knew a reparations claim could be made by living victims.",
