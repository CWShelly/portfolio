I'm surprised by what we end up talking about. I didn't expect to learn how the French say 'Groundhog Day', but now I know, and now I've explained our silly tradition to a woman who informed me that, in France, on the exact same day, they celebrate 'La Chandeleur', or, essentially 'The Day of Crêpes.' So, yeah, they basically celebrate February 2, with crêpes. SOOO much better than waiting for a rodent to see or not see his shadow (although the little guy IS adorable)... Sometimes things get lost in the translation. I told her that the groundhog is prediciting a short winter, but that I don't know if I believe him, and now she thinks I'm a global warming-denier. </p> "
